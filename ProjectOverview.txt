# Vet Clinic Appointment Enterprise Solution: Pet Society

## Introduction
Currently, medical appointments for pets are booked through old-fashioned methods such as calling the clinic, or bringing the pet to the clinic on short notice. There is a lack of a one-stop online portal that connects pet owners with veterinary clinics when booking their pet’s medical appointments in Singapore. Our solution gives pet owners the ability to search for suitable clinics and book medical appointments for their pets, while simultaneously allowing clinics to manage their appointments.

## Installation
1. Ensure that WAMP/MAMP server is up and running
2. Run the following SQL files in PhpMyAdmin to create necessary databases for the microservices. These files can be found in the following path: ‘app/sql/file.sql’

	i) booking.sql
	ii) clinic.sql
	iii) medical_record.sql
	iv) user.sql

3. Ensure that docker is up and running
4. Open up file docker-compose.yml in directory 'app/docker-compose.yml' and replace all 'marcusgoh' with your docker's username.
5. Start all of the microservices by running command 'docker-compose up' in the following directory 'app'.
6. Open the app by accessing ‘localhost/app/ui/public/php/’. User will be directed to the index page of the site for pet owners to login.
7. After screen loads, click 'Customer Sign up' button on the left of the page to reach the Sign Up page for the start of the first user scenario.
